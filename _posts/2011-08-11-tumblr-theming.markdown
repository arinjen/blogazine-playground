Tumblr lets you fully customize the appearance of your blog by editing your theme's HTML code. This is only recommended for users comfortable hand-coding HTML. If you're not, there are hundreds of great themes to choose from in the Theme Garden!

Once you've created a theme you're proud of, submit it to the Theme Garden to share with everyone on Tumblr! OK. It's not related with Tumblr anymore. We talk about Github. Why I use Github?

* It's easy
* It's free, *yeah*
* It's never down

###Move to Jekyll and Github###
Now, I use Jekyll and Github for blogging. People say, "Blogging like a Hacker". Yeah, it could be like that cause we can write the article in the terminal and publish it via terminal too. Jekyll used as a local CMS for rendering the post. The post using Textile, Markdown, or plain HTML document.

So that's why I started to learn Markdown syntax, also Textile. We can still use plain HTML, but I think is easier to use Markdown or Textile. It automatically escape the character using the hex code, so it will **validated**.
